# ChrisEmporium

This is my first time ever using this, I am exploring.

This is for my main website www.chrisemporium.ca , which will be home to a few sub pages, like a forum, updates, some background music perhaps.

## Setup Instructions

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Beuvan/ChrisEmporium.git
